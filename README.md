This is primarily an educational project. I'm trying to learn how to use huggingface tools to build a transcription tool I can use to automate meeting minutes. The plan is to start by following the hugging face transcription tutorial then start modifying it to be more useful for more specific use cases.

The original tutorial is here: https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/en/chapter7/transcribe-meeting
